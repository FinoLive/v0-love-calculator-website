            Breakups are more than just emotional rollercoastersâ€”they can feel like a physical wound. Your chest
            tightens, sleep evades you, and even your favorite foods lose their flavor. But here's the thing: while
            heartbreak is universal, how you navigate it can transform pain into growth. Let's explore science-backed
            strategies to heal, rebuild, and emerge stronger.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Breakups Hurt So Much (It's Science!)</h2>
            <p>
              Before diving into solutions, let's normalize the ache. Breakups activate the same brain regions linked to
              physical pain, like the anterior cingulate cortex (Verywell Mind). This explains why "heartache" isn't
              just metaphoricalâ€”it can cause fatigue, appetite changes, and even weakened immunity.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Psychologically, the loss often triggers a grief-like response, blending sadness, anger, and identity
              confusion (ScienceDaily). Understanding this helps you treat yourself with kindness. You're not
              "overreacting"â€”your brain and body are processing a seismic shift.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sleep Like It's Your Job:</strong> Breakups disrupt sleep cycles, but poor rest heightens
              emotional volatility. Prioritize a bedtime routineâ€”think warm tea, no screens, and calming playlists.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Move Your Body:</strong> Exercise releases endorphins, counteracting stress hormones. Even a
              10-minute walk helps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nourish Yourself:</strong> Loss often kills appetite, but steady blood sugar stabilizes mood. Opt
              for easy, nutrient-rich snacks like nuts or smoothies.
            </li>
          </ul>

              "regretting," "planning"). This creates mental space to choose how you respond.
